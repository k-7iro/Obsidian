A simple encryption system for ComputerCraft. Key length is flexible.

Warning: This encryption is not guaranteed to be particularly efficient or particularly secure. The author takes no responsibility for any consequences resulting from the use of this encryption system. The author is not a cryptography professional, just a hobbyist. The only good thing about this system is that the code size is very small. Apart from that, AES is a 100x better symmetric key encryption system.
